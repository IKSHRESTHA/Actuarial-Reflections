## Introduction to Data Pipelines

Data pipelines are structured systems designed to automate the flow of data from various sources to destination systems where it can be analyzed and used for business intelligence. These pipelines handle extraction, transformation, loading, processing, and management of data across different environments.

In today's data-driven world, organizations face overwhelming volumes of data from disparate sources. Data pipelines enable businesses to efficiently process this information, ensuring data reliability, consistency, and accessibility when needed.

## The Anatomy of a Data Pipeline

A typical data pipeline consists of these core components:

1. **Data Sources**: Where raw data originates (databases, applications, APIs, streaming sources)
2. **Extraction Layer**: Pulls data from source systems
3. **Transformation Layer**: Cleans, validates, and restructures data
4. **Loading Layer**: Delivers processed data to destination systems
5. **Orchestration**: Manages workflow scheduling and dependencies
6. **Monitoring**: Tracks pipeline health and performance

### Modern Pipeline Architectures

#### Batch Processing
Batch processing means working with a lot of data at once, instead of one record at a time. In life insurance, actuaries use batch processing to study how policies and claims behave over time. For example, you might want to see how many claims happened in different age groups, and compare that to what you expected.

In R, you can connect to a SQL database and use two helpful packages:
- **DBI**: Lets you connect to databases like MySQL, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL.
- **dplyr**: Makes it easy to select, join, and summarize data.

Here is a simple example. This code will NOT run unless you change `eval=FALSE` to `eval=TRUE` and fill in your real database details.

```{r batch_experience_study, eval=FALSE}
library(DBI)      # Connect to databases
library(dplyr)    # Work with data easily

# Connect to your SQL database (update with your info)
con <- dbConnect(
  RMySQL::MySQL(),
  dbname = "life_insurance_db",
  host = "your_host",
  user = "your_user",
  password = "your_password"
)

# Get policy and claims data from the database
df_policies <- tbl(con, "policies")
df_claims <- tbl(con, "claims")

# Join and summarize: How many claims vs expected, by age and policy type
summary <- df_policies %>%
  left_join(df_claims, by = "policy_id") %>%
  group_by(age_band, policy_type) %>%
  summarise(
    total_policies = n(),
    total_claims = sum(!is.na(claim_id)),
    expected_claims = sum(expected_claim),
    actual_claims = sum(claim_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    claim_ratio = actual_claims / expected_claims
  )

# To see the results, collect the summary from the database
# summary %>% collect()

# Always disconnect when done
# dbDisconnect(con)
```

**What does this do?**
- Connects to your database
- Gets policy and claims data
- Joins them together
- Groups by age and policy type
- Counts policies, claims, and calculates actual vs expected claims

This is a common way actuaries use R and SQL to study insurance data in batches. You can change the code to fit your own database and analysis needs.

#### Stream Processing
Processes data in real-time as it arrives. Essential for applications requiring immediate insights.

```{r}
# Conceptual example: Stream processing in R (using a simulated stream)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
stream_data <- map(1:10, ~data.frame(timestamp = Sys.time(), value = rnorm(1)))
stream_df <- bind_rows(stream_data)
# Real-time aggregation
stream_df %>% group_by(minute = format(timestamp, "%H:%M")) %>% summarise(avg_value = mean(value))
```

#### ELT vs ETL
Modern pipelines often adopt ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) over traditional ETL, leveraging cloud data warehouses for transformations.

## Building a Modern Data Pipeline: Step-by-Step

### 1. Define Pipeline Requirements
- What data sources need to be integrated?
- What is the required data freshness (real-time vs. batch)?
- What transformations are needed?
- What's the expected data volume?
- What are the end-user requirements?

### 2. Choose the Right Architecture
- **Batch processing** (Spark, dbt, dplyr)
- **Stream processing** (Kafka, Flink)
- **Hybrid approaches** (Lambda or Kappa architecture)

### 3. Implement Data Quality Controls

```{r}
# Example: Data quality check in R
data <- data.frame(customer_id = c(1,2,NA,4), transaction_amount = c(100, 200, 300, NA))
# Check for missing values
dplyr::summarise_all(data, ~sum(is.na(.)))
# Check for valid transaction amounts
all(data$transaction_amount >= 0 & data$transaction_amount <= 10000, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### 4. Orchestrate Pipeline Flows

- Use tools like Airflow, Prefect, or R's `targets` package for workflow management.

## Example: Batch Processing Life Insurance Data from SQL

Batch processing means working with large amounts of data at once, instead of handling each record one by one. In life insurance, actuaries often use batch processing to study how policies perform over time. For example, you might want to compare the number of claims to what you expected for different age groups and policy types.

In R, you can connect to a SQL database and use two main packages:
- **DBI**: Helps you connect to databases like MySQL, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL.
- **dplyr**: Makes it easy to select, join, and summarize data.

#### Batch Processing in Life Insurance (Advanced Example)

Batch processing lets actuaries analyze large amounts of insurance data efficiently. For complex experience studies, you might want to:
- Calculate actual vs expected claims by age, gender, and product type
- Analyze lapse rates and persistency
- Segment results by region or distribution channel
- Join multiple tables (policies, claims, premiums, agents)
- Apply business rules for exclusions or adjustments

In R, you use `DBI` to connect to your SQL database and `dplyr` to write readable, powerful queries. Below is an advanced example. 

```{r batch_experience_study_advanced, eval=FALSE}
library(DBI)      # For database connections
library(dplyr)    # For data manipulation

# Connect to your SQL database (update with your info)
con <- dbConnect(
  RMySQL::MySQL(),
  dbname = "life_insurance_db",
  host = "your_host",
  user = "your_user",
  password = "your_password"
)

# Get tables from the database
df_policies <- tbl(con, "policies")
df_claims <- tbl(con, "claims")
df_premiums <- tbl(con, "premiums")
df_agents <- tbl(con, "agents")

# Advanced aggregation: Experience study by age, gender, product, and region
experience_summary <- df_policies %>%
  left_join(df_claims, by = "policy_id") %>%
  left_join(df_premiums, by = "policy_id") %>%
  left_join(df_agents, by = "agent_id") %>%
  filter(policy_status == "active", !is.na(issue_date)) %>%
  group_by(age_band, gender, product_type, region) %>%
  summarise(
    total_policies = n(),
    total_claims = sum(!is.na(claim_id)),
    total_premium = sum(premium_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    expected_claims = sum(expected_claim),
    actual_claims = sum(claim_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    claim_ratio = actual_claims / expected_claims,
    avg_policy_duration = mean(as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), issue_date, units = "days")) / 365.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    lapse_rate = mean(policy_status == "lapsed"),
    agent_count = n_distinct(agent_id)
  )

# To see the results, collect the summary from the database
experience_summary %>% collect()

dbDisconnect(con)
```
